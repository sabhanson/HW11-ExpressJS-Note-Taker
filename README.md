# Node JS Note Taker [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description
I designed this Note Taking website for a user to create and save a list of notes. When they visit the site, they are able to add a note with a title and text body. They're able to access that note by clicking it on the left side. The user can easily delete a note by clicking on the red trash icon next to the particular note.
